# Tutorial on Recent Feature Tracking Techniques

The purpose of this tutorial is to review feature tracking, which is a traditional but still core research topic in scientific visualization.  In general, feature tracking aims at characterizing and understanding the evolution of features in time-varying scientific datasets, including scalar and vector fields.  The tutorial has two main sessions: the first session will review general techniques including statistics, topology, and combinatorial based feature tracking algorithms; the second session will then present specific feature tracking algorithms for complex-valued scalar fields and flow fields.  The tutorial will also organize a short panel discussion on future research directions on feature tracking.

## Talks

### Statistics Based Feature Extraction and Tracking (Han-Wei Shen)

[Slides](shen.pdf)

<b>Abstract:</b> 
Scientists overview and identify regions of interest by transforming
data into compact information descriptors that characterize simulation
results and allow detailed analysis on demand. Among many existing
feature descriptors, statistical information derived from data samples
is a promising approach to taming the big data avalanche because data
distributions computed from a population can compactly describe the
presence and characteristics of salient data features with minimal
data movement. The ability to computationally summarize and process
data using distributions also provides an efficient and representative
capture of information that can adjust to size and resource
constraints, with the added benefit that uncertainty associated with
the results can be quantified and communicated.  In this tutorial, I will
discuss several recent works on using distributions as a new paradiagm for
representing large scale scientific data sets.  The goal is to
ensure that scientists can easily obtain an overview of the entire
data set regardless of the size of the simulation output; understand
the characteristics and locations of features; easily interact with
the data and select regions and features of interest; and perform all
the analysis tasks with a small memory footprint.

### Topology-based feature tracking in scalar fields (Gunther Weber)

[Slides](weber.pdf)

<b>Abstract:</b>
With increasing size and dimensionality, time-varying data become difficult to visualize and analyze. One solution to this challenge is to detect features, i.e., salient data subsets, at each point in time and track their evolution to obtain more compact and less cluttered visualizations. We focus on scalar fields, where many feature definitions are based on super-/sub-level sets and isosurfaces. Starting with overlap tracking, feature tracking approaches have evolved considerably over the years. Topology-based methods provide solid theoretical foundation for correlating and tracking features. We will review feature definitions ins scalar fields based on super-/sub-level sets and isosurfaces and how they relate to topological structures like merge-tree, contour tree and Reeb graph. Subsequently, we will provide an overview of topology-based methods that use contour trees, merge-trees and the Reeb graph and discuss their respective advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we will review presentation of tracking information, including tracking features at multiple levels and how effective representation relates to the chosen tracking approach.

### Feature-Tracking using Discrete Methods (Tino Weinkauf)

[Slides](weinkauf.pdf)

<b>Abstract:</b>
We explore several different feature tracking techniques based on topological descriptions of scalar data. This includes tracking critical points using the discrete Morse-Smale complex as well as tracking regions defined by subtrees of merge trees. The talk focuses on discrete methods that allow for combinatorial algorithms. Furthermore, we extend the idea of feature comparison to spatio-temporal features and explore how this helps in understanding time-dependent data.

### Feature Extraction and Tracking in Complex-Valued Scalar Fields (Hanqi Guo)

[Slides](guo.pdf)

<b>Abstract:</b>
Topological singularities, or vortices, in 3D complex-valued scalar fields are the most important features in many scientific applications including superconductivity, superfluidity, and Bose-Einstein condensation.  This talk presents a method for the extraction and tracking of vortices for both structured and unstructured mesh superconductivity simulations.  This method represents each vortex line as a connected graph extracted from the discretized field in both space and time.  For a time-varying discrete dataset, our vortex extraction and tracking method is as accurate as the data discretization. We then apply 3D visualization and 2D event diagrams to the extraction and tracking results to help scientists understand vortex dynamics and macroscale superconductor behavior in greater detail than previously possible.  In addition, we present an workflow that extracts and tracks vortices in situ.

### Feature extraction and tracking using vector field decompositions (Harsh Bhatia)

[Slides](bhatia.pdf)

<b>Abstract:</b>
Extraction and time tracking of flow features is critical to explore the underlying phenomena, and several types of approaches have been proposed to this end. In this session, I will discuss a series of techniques that utilize vector field decompositions to extract and track coherent features in flow fields. Starting with Polthier and PreuÃŸ's work on computing the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition on triangulations and its applications to compute critical points, I will talk about several improvements, including different applications as well as 3D computations. I will also discuss the more-recently proposed <em>natural Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition</em>, and present how it has been used to extract temporally coherent features through internal reference frames.
